I’m a software engineering student based in Hungary who takes great interest in programming and software design. I believe in free, open-source, fast and efficient software.

In my opinion, most apps are bloated these days, so I want to become an engineer who can offset this trend. I’m still on the path of learning!

I mainly program in Rust, although I learn C++, Java and Haskell - amongst many other languages - at university as well.
